#Kick:

  (bools 1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0)   #Section 1
]                         #Extend to add more sections
#Snare
pat_snare = [

#Hihat:
pat_hat = [
  (bools 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1),
  (bools 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)

#Copy and adapt for more samples

#Section Pattern:
sections = (ring 0,0,0,1).stretch(8)  #stretch should have the pattern length as parameter, otherwise weird things will happen
